## Overview

The outcome variables in these plots come from the variables called `AGEN_WORK_..`, `COMM_WORK_..`, etc. in the SPSS file you sent. I created plots for each rating type, e.g., Responsible, Trustworthy, etc., and for an overall composite of all the rating type. 

Looking at the patterns of data in these plots, gender doesn't seem to be a very salient cue for participants. The patterns for the male and female targets are very consistent. There does seem to be a suggestion that forgetting to do something at work (especially if it's a communal task) is judged more negatively than forgetting something at home -- regardless of target gender. 

## By trait

### Responsible

```{r fig.width=9}
plot_data %>% 
	filter(trait == "responsible") %>% 
	pull(p)
```


### Trustworthy

```{r fig.width=9}
plot_data %>% 
	filter(trait == "trustworthy") %>% 
	pull(p)
```


### Disciplined


```{r fig.width=9}
plot_data %>% 
	filter(trait == "disciplined") %>% 
	pull(p)
```


### Competence

```{r fig.width=9}
plot_data %>% 
	filter(trait == "competence") %>% 
	pull(p)
```


### Intelligent

```{r fig.width=9}
plot_data %>% 
	filter(trait == "intelligent") %>% 
	pull(p)
```

```{r fig.width=9}
plot_data %>% 
	filter(trait == "resourceful") %>% 
	pull(p)
```


### Sincere

	filter(trait == "sincere") %>%
